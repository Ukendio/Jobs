And we have no plans to stop, we are still growing with even more ambitious projects to come. 

**Your task** 

Our latest project is an exciting one! We have a skyscraper and we need you to decorate individual floors with a shop! Each shop needs to have a pathway of which a "manager" (an NPC that goes back-n-forth [straight line]), be egg-themed, and follow a building-template that will be provided! Skills withing 3D modeling is valuable but not essential.
