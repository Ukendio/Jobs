We have a horse model from our game, [Horse Valley](https://www.roblox.com/games/2830250344/Horse-Valley), that we would like to a make a smaller and skinnier version of! In our game, players can breed new horses, these horses start out as Foals
and grow up to become either a mare or a stallion. 

Below I have attached an image of our horse rig and following, a reference image of a foal.

Our current horse models is skinned and have been separated into pieces like R15, your task will be to take the existing rig, make it skinnier and map bones to the rig. The completion of the job is when the new foal rig is compatible with our existing technology, like attaching attachments such as
bridles, saddles, manes, and etc. We will provide you with a FBX file of the current horse rig and you will work from there.
