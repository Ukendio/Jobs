## Job description

**Who we are**
Ming Media is a game studio that has over five years on the platform, with over half a billion visits under its name. You may know us from numerous games such as [Pick A Side](https://www.roblox.com/games/663655429/Pick-A-Side?refPageId=e2300cc5-1034-4ce6-aa21-ec43582f1de6), [Horse Valley 2](https://www.roblox.com/games/2830250344/Horse-Valley-2-BETA?refPageId=7b139857-6536-45c8-97d2-2a88e43f3750), [Egg Farm Simulator](https://www.roblox.com/games/1828509885/AUTO-EGGS-Egg-Farm-Simulator?refPageId=7b139857-6536-45c8-97d2-2a88e43f3750), [Action!](https://www.roblox.com/games/1069607513/Action?refPageId=887ffd69-244a-41b7-aa93-7df7e3e1af6f), and many more. And we have no plans to stop, we are still growing with even more ambitious projects to come. 
Our first successful game on the platform Horse Valley, was made in 2016. After years of ask and expectations, we finally released Horse Valley 2 which has been in Beta for a while now and has amassed a peak of over 500 players, retaining a concurrent of 400 players daily as a paid access game. 

**Your task** 
Our current horse models have been separated into pieces like R15, due to how Roblox worked before skinned meshes, but now that skinned meshes has been released into Beta as well, we want to re-implement our horses as skinned meshes which of course needs to work with what was previously possible, like attaching attachments such as
bridles, saddles, manes, and etc! We will provide a WIP skinned-horse with a bone-hierarchy and a few barebones weight-painting but we suggest that you re-work these foundations so that things will work properly.
