This job is for our game, [Horse Valley](https://www.roblox.com/games/2830250344/Horse-Valley) we need want to migrate our rigid horse rigs to be compatible with the skinned meshes update.

Since before we have tried to do this on multiple times to no avail, it is a very delicate job that requires a lot of persistence and retrial. The job entails to rig the horse as R15 and weightpaint the horse so that it is completely compatible with all previous animations that were made for the rigid mesh. The weightpaint is going to determine how the skinned mesh deforms and therefore needs to look good with any of our attachable items. If the weightpaint is done correctly, it will be exactly the same as the aforementioned rigid body and thus comply to our horse animations.
